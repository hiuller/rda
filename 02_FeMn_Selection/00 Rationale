  The aim of this study is to identify wether there is any opportunity to optimize the alloy selection for manganese incorporation to steel.
  
  Fact sheet:
  (1) Aimmed P content influences the selection of alloys. The operator also has power to change the selection.
  
  Questions to be answered
  (1) Do we take bad decisions, regardless its a result of operator's choice or model calculation?
      Do we use low phosforus alloy in steels that don't require it to avoid, let's say, a reblow?
      
  (2) What is the proportion of times where we choose the more expensive alloy?
      When do we don't use MnAC when it is possible?
      
  (3) Non-deoxidized tapping:
  
  (4) Amepa influence: Amepa startup was in Sep/10.
